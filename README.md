# Is this a real V-Buck site?
##### A browser extension that helps you recongnize legitimate V-Bucks sites.

Fortnite has caused quite the security kerfuffle. Between releasing the Android app [outside](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2018/09/fortnite-google-play-rebuff-sparks-security-concerns-for-android/) [the](https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/24/fortnites-android-installer-shipped-with-an-epic-security-flaw/) [Google Play Store](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/10/17675054/google-play-store-android-fortnite-battle-royale) and an insane desire for V-Bucks, scams are running rampant.

Wired put out this article today entitled ["Fortnite scams are even worse than you thought"](https://www.wired.com/story/fortnite-scams-even-worse-than-you-thought/), and it made me sad that people are being tricked (that's for tomorrow ðŸŽƒ). So I made this simple browser extension as a helpful reminder of legitimate V-Buck sites!

## Installation

Download the extension files by clicking "Clone or download > Download Zip" here on Github

Then follow steps 1, 2, and 3 [here](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#manifest) to install the extension

(Yes, enabling Developer mode to sideload extensions is a similar security whole to what Epic is doing with Fortnite on Android. I'll look into publishing the extension officially.)
